          <!-- Post Content -->
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">It’s been almost exactly a year since I left Boston to start work with TATA Consultancy Services (TCS), and just a few days ago, I told my company that I would be stepping down. It was somewhat weird having that discussion with HR just because I was supposed to have relocated to Philadelphia for a project with Comcast that same Monday – they weren’t too happy with my last second decision. However, in my defense, I only received news about my offer letter towards the end of that day the previous Friday. You might be thinking “what offer letter?!” Ok, lets slow it down and rewind a few months to when I started job hunting.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">During mid-March, I wrapped up my project at PriceWaterhouseCooper working as a Software Engineer through my company. After that project had ended, I was what you called “on the bench”. Although I was still employed by my company, I wasn’t allocated to a project. It eventually took TCS a little over two months to find me a project, which was the Comcast project that I had to ditch last second. The process took FOREVER because the two people who were looking for projects for me moved very slowly. I remember I reached out to them multiple times to check in, but it didn’t help. This was completely fine with me though since I was still getting paid for just “working” from home. During that time, I could’ve done pretty much anything I wanted to. I could’ve flown to one of the Hawaiian Islands and lived in a hostel for an extended period of time (which I seriously considered doing because I wasn’t too happy in Cincinnati), enjoying the beautiful beaches and being surrounded in nature.  The only thing I would’ve had to do every day was to check my work email and answer any company calls. Not bad, right? That would’ve been super nice, but instead, I started applying to jobs and brushing up on my interview skills.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">At the point, I’ve been with my company for about a year and figured that was enough experience to land me a different job. In particular, I really wanted to find something in Boston because I messed my family and friends there. Cincinnati is a cool city, but it just wasn’t for me (I’ll dedicate another blog to this). For the next two months, my day consisted of applying to jobs, in which I had sprint sessions where I sent out as many resumes and cover letters as possible, and in addition, I also did lots of coding interview, system design, and object-oriented design questions on top of brushing up on Java and Javascript fundamentals. At the end of the two months, I had applied to a little over 100 jobs (not including the jobs that recruiting agencies sent my profile to). Of those jobs, only five led to final round interviews, and from those five, I ended up getting an offer from two.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The first offer I received was from a company by the name of Frontline Education. I really respected the company mission since they make software for schools K-12, and I would’ve been doing backend work as a Java Software Developer for their special education software. The people on the team that I met with were all super cool. They were all a lot older than I was, but that was by no means a deciding factor. I ultimately passed the offer despite it being a very though decision. If I had gone with this position, I most definitely would’ve had a more comfortable time adapting to the tech environment since I’m familiar with Java, as opposed to the technologies and language that I’ll be using for the job that I went with. The reason I went with my second offer is because I wanted to experience working in a start-up environment, especially after having worked for a big company like TCS. Another deciding factor, and although not as important, was distance. If I had gone with Frontline Education, I would’ve had to commute 45 minutes from Boston going to and from work. I wouldn’t have minded making the commute, since that’s only a tad longer than the commute from where I live now to my company office, but not having to do so is always nicer.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The offer I ended up taking is with a start-up by the name of Jebbit, located right in the Seaport area of Boston. Jebbit’s a relatively new company founded in 2011 by two Boston College students, with the goal of building the world’s first declared data platform used for assumption-free marketing. What this means is that it’ll let consumers personalize (hence the declared data) the ads they want to see instead of seeing ads based on inferred or brought data. As for the position, I’ll be working as a full-stack developer using Ruby, Node, EmberJS, some AWS, and the typical test-driven development and deployment stuff. I’m a bit nervous about Ruby since I have 0 experience with it, but I have plenty of time to learn since I’m not starting until the 24th of June. I was originally supposed to start the 17th but I asked to push it back a week so I could go on vacation prior to starting. However, now that I think of it, I might just spend the majority of my time just learning those new technologies. That way I don’t show up on my first day feeling like a blank slate. Maybe I could do both? I’ll keep you updated!</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Also, this is my first blog that I’ve written in over a year, so I definitely want to keep the momentum going! Be on the lookout for more coming!</p>
