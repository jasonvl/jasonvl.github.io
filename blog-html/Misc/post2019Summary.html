          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">A wise friend once told me that when you’re drunk, the normal laws of time doesn’t apply because, instead, you run on drunk time. Drunk time is just time slowed down. Yes, yes, it’s a bunch of BS and to be fair, he told that to me so I wouldn’t wake him from his nap as soon. </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Anyway, 2019 felt like the opposite of drunk time because everything moved crazy fast. You could say I’ve been livin’ the fast life.</p>

          <p>Here are some significant things that happened in 2019, in chronological order.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">1) Moved back to Cambridge from fuckville nowhere Ohio. Just joking, Cincinnati is a cool city, but I was just bored there since I didn’t know many people. One good thing that I got out of living there was that I got pretty jacked since I had nothing to do besides gyming six times a week (you’re welcome, ladies). Furthermore, it also made me realize the importance of having good roommates just because the two that I lived with were messy and disorganized beyond belief (if you’re reading this Hunter, no I’m not talking about you). Actually, the word messy doesn’t even do them justice. Messy^2 would be more accurate.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">2) Started two jobs. Why two? Because two is better than one. Kidding. The first job was at a tech startup in the Seaport part of Boston where I was a full-stack developer. Although I loved the work culture and my coworkers, I wasn’t satisfied with the tech stack and monolithic software architecture that we were using. Fast forward three and a half months, and I started a new position that more closely aligns with the technologies that I see myself using in the future. I do owe Jebbit an apology that I took the 5k signing bonus after working there for such a short period of time. PSYCH. Totally not sorry. </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">My best memory of Jebbit was that time when we throw a party (I don’t even remember what it was for) and everyone got so drunk that some people slept overnight at the office. I guess that’s what happens when you have an open bar and live band.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">3) For the first time, I participated in a triathlon. Funny thing is that, after having trained ferociously with my friend for a month and a half, and paying the hefty registration fee, my dumbass somehow blew out my back doing squats the week of the race, and so I couldn’t complete. I still went to cheer my friend on and pick up my triathlon swag that came with the registration package. I also ALMOST asked if I could still have a participation medal even though I didn’t do anything. It would’ve made a nice room décor though.</p>
         
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The most memorable training day was when my friend and I decided it was a good idea to do our weekly 20k bike ride and 5k jog despite the mayor of Boston declaring a heat emergency because “the heat index for both Saturday and Sunday is forecast to be 105 degrees or higher” (source: https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/07/18/boston-heat-emergency-hot-weather-safety-tips-walsh/). That was possibly one of the worst decisions of my life not only because we almost passed out, but because it caused me to be super late for a first date with a girl that I met on Hindge. Sorry, Kelsey, and the only reason I still remember your name was because you were so damn attractive.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">4) I finally got good at seasoning food accordingly to one of my roomies. He would always give me so much shit because I would either only use salt and/or peppers, or forgot to season at all. It wasn’t until a couple days ago that, after having tasted the chicken I made for dinner, told me “Hey Jason, this is actually not bad.” Ayy time of my life right there. It ONLY took me 25 years to learn.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">A forte of mine is making breakfast bagels. No one, and I mean, ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY NO ONE, can make better breakfast bagels than me. Here’s the secret for those of you who are curious
          1)  Buy the freshest bagels you can find. No, I’m not talking about those Market Basket ones because believe me, I’ve left those on the pantry for months on end, and never once did it get moldy. That ain’t natural.
          2)  Cut some Brie cheese and put it on both halves of the bagel. Put in toaster oven.
          3)  Cook two eggs.
          4)  Cut an avocado.
          5)  Once the bagel is nicely toasted, smear some basil or sun-dried tomatoe pesto on it.
          6)  Add the egg and avocado on the bagel.

          You’re welcome ;-) 
          </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Also, big apologies to all the Hindge girls out there that that I told “we gotta hang cuz I’ll make you the BEST hashbrows ever.” A) that’s only an opener B) I have no idea how to make hasbrowns C) I’ve never even made hashbrowns D) I will probably never make hashbrowns just because boiling potatoes takes so damn long. E) yes, I realized that the correct spelling of “hashbrowns” is “hash browns” but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">5)  Got into a car accident not too long ago during my commute to work. Thankfully everyone is OK, but my insurance company won’t be too happy because I rear-ended a brand new 2018 BMW. In my defense, the road was slippery due to slush, and the fact that I was going down a declined slope didn’t help. The interesting thing is that, for about three seconds, I just sat there with my foot on the break, hands tightly clenching on to the steering wheel, thinking to myself “aww fuck me I’m aboutta hit this dude and there’s nothing I can do.” The worst part was that everyone in the office left super early anyways so I could’ve would’ve should’ve just worked from home in the first place. Life can be a real bitch sometimes.</p>

          <p>That’s it for significant events of 2019!</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> I’d also like to add a section for things that I’ve learned this year, like, as in wisdom that other people passed along to me, or wisdom that I discovered myself. However, it’s 7:40PM as I’m writing this and I’m super hungry, so I’ll have to raincheck it. 
          </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">As for my financial summary, my total spending came out to *drumroll* $25,109.96. This includes everything that I’ve ever spent money on this year such as rent, food, gas, alcohol, etc. I keep a detailed excel sheet of my spending, and I have different categories for organizational and statistical purposes. 
          </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">My total includes all earnings (not from work or from the sale of stocks) and cashback that I received from credit cards. For cashback, I received a total of $1,288.83 from four different credit cards including sign-up bonuses. One thing to note is that with my Uber credit card, I had already received $500 in cash-back from the previous year, which I had not redeemed before, so my “true” cashback cost is $788.83. That means the percentage of cashback compared to my total spending is 3.14%. And ladies and gentlemen, that is why you should use a credit card if you aren’t already. </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Fun fact: total grocery spending was $3,355.43, which breaks down to $69 per week. Shout-out to Costco and Market Basket for making that possible.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Fun fact 2: most useless thing I got this year was the Boring Flamethrower (thanks Elon Musk) costing about $800. I actually purchased two. The first one I resold to make a 30% profit, and the other one I’m keeping just because it’s cool. I might decide to sell it later if the value goes up, but right now it’s like owning a share of the Boring Company.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">As for stocks, my total gains this year is $7.8k mostly from tech stocks. Not great but I think there’s room for improvement in 2020.</p>

          <p>That’s a wrap-up of my year.</p>

          <p>Thanks for reading, and hope you’re having a great start of 2020.</p>

         <p>Also, I didn't do any proof-reading so there's probably tons of typos. I'm super hungry so gonna make dinner instead haha.</p>
